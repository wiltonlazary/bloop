# bloop `v1.5.5`

One of the notable changes in this release for anyone using the `bloop-config`
artifact is that it's no longer contained inside of this repo or versioned along
with it. You can find its new location in
[scalacenter/bloop-config](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop-config). The
latest version of `bloop-config` is still 1.5.5 and you'll continue to use it as
you normally have.

Bloop v1.5.5 also ships a new major version of the Scala Debug Adapter,
featuring better debugging steps (step filter), conditional breakpoints,
logpoints and more. See a full list of features in the release notes of the
Scala Debug Adapter
[3.0.1](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-debug-adapter/releases/tag/v3.0.1)
and
[3.0.3](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-debug-adapter/releases/tag/v3.0.3).
