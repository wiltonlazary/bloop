Bloop supports several build tools with varying degree of functionality.

| Build tool |  **Build export**   | **Built-in Compile / Test / Run** |
| ---------- | :-----------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| sbt        |         ‚úÖ          |          ‚úÖ experimental          |

## Build Export

The most basic integration is **Build Export**. Build export is a task in your
build tool that translates your build definitions to Bloop configuration files,
which are used by Bloop to compile, test and run your Scala code. It provides
all you need to get started with Bloop.

Exporting your build is supported by a large array of popular Scala and Java
build tools. However, it's a tedious process that users must remember to run
whenever their build changes (client integrations such as
[Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) can export the build automatically, but that's
usually not the case if you're interfacing directly with the bloop CLI).

## Built-in compile, test and run

**Built-in compile, test and run** is a richer build tool integration that swaps
your build tool's implementation of `compile`, `test` and `run` by their
implementation in Bloop. This integration relieves users from exporting the
build (build export is automatic) and instead provides a transparent build tool
integration users are unaware of.

Whereas built-in integrations are not fully developed yet, a built-in build tool
integration for sbt is planned for the next release. These integrations will
help users benefit from the speed and reliability of a more modern Scala
toolchain with minimum interference in their current workflow.
